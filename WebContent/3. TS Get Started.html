TypeScript Compiler
TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript using a compiler.

Installing the Compiler
TypeScript has an official compiler which can be installed through npm.
npm install typescript --save-dev

The compiler is installed in the node_modules directory and can be run with: npx tsc.

-----------
Configuring the compiler
The compiler can be configured using a tsconfig.json file.

You can have TypeScript create tsconfig.json with the recommended settings with:
npx tsc --init

Here is an example of more things you could add to the tsconfig.json file:

{
  "include": ["src"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./build"
  }
}
You can open the file in an editor to add those options. This will configure the TypeScript compiler to transpile TypeScript files located in the src/ directory of your project, into JavaScript files in the build/ directory.
